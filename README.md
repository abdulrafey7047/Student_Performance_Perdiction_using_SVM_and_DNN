# Student Performance Perdiction using SVM and DNN
This repository uses two different approaches, one Machine Learning and one Deep Learning, to train models for predicting student perfromance.
The dataset used can be at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set

For the machine learning approach a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained and for the deep learning approach a simple feed forwarf neural network is trained
